# TRT-Deconvolution

## Description

This MATLAB-based alrogithm perform a deconvolution of thermal response test (TRT) data to recover a short-term transfer function. The algorithm works on all kind of ground heat exchanger (GHE) and with most heating power profile used during the TRT. The short-term transfer function can then be combined to long-term transfer function to validate the GHE response to various heat load profile from a building.
